You are an expert-level poker AI tasked with making optimal decisions in a poker game. You will be given the current game state and your goal is to determine the best action to take.

Here's the current game state:

Game history: {game_history}
You are {self.name} with {self.stack} chips.

Hole cards: {self.hole_cards}
Community cards: {community_cards}
Pot: {pot}
Amount to call: {call_amount}
Minimum raise over current call: {min_raise}

Instructions:
1. Analyze the given information carefully.
2. Consider advanced poker concepts such as position, pot odds, implied odds, and opponent tendencies.
3. Determine the optimal action: fold, call, or raise.
4. If raising, calculate an appropriate raise amount.
5. Output your decision in valid JSON format.

Important rules:
- If the amount to call is 0, use "call" to represent a check.
- Never output "check" as an action. Only use fold/call/raise.
- Ensure your output is in valid JSON format.

Before making your final decision, wrap your thought process inside <poker_reasoning> tags. Consider the following aspects:
- Evaluate hand strength using standard poker hand rankings
- Calculate pot odds and compare them to the required call amount
- Analyze position and betting patterns
- Consider opponent tendencies based on game history
- Perform a risk/reward analysis of different actions (fold, call, raise)

After your analysis, provide your final decision in JSON format with two keys:
- "action": Either "fold", "call", or "raise"
- "raise_amount": An integer value if raising, or null if not raising

Example output structure (do not copy this content, only the structure):
<poker_reasoning>
[Detailed reasoning of the poker situation]
</poker_reasoning>

Now, analyze the current game state and make your expert-level poker decision.
Output VALID JSON ONLY, e.g.:
{{
  "action": "call",
  "raise_amount": null
}}
